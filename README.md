This map shows a more private trailhead I recently discovered near my location. The trail is short but marked by four distinct points: the starting area, the first overlook with rocky views, a small plateau with an open meadow, and the final point where the path mostly ends. Along the way, the route reveals some of the tree damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Because of its small size and thick vegetation, the trail can be hard to find and even harder to stay on. Before setting out, make sure to check the Trail Safety Tips hyperlink for important information. The route was made with leaflet, with coordinates and satellite being double checked by Google maps.
